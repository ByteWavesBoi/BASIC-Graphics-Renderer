# Stationary 2D Point Projection in QBasic

This is a minimal QBasic program that projects a single point onto a 2D screen and displays it as a small filled square.

## How It Works

- The program takes a 3D point with coordinates `(x, y, z)`.
- It projects the 3D point onto a 2D plane using a simple perspective projection.
- No rotation is applied, so the point stays stationary on the screen.
- The projected point is drawn as a small white square to make it visible.

## How to Use

1. Open the `.BAS` file in QBasic.
2. Edit the coordinates of the point by changing the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` near the top of the code.
3. Run the program.
4. A white square will appear on the screen representing the 3D point projected onto 2D.
